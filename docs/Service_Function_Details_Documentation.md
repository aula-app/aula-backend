# Summary of Functionalities


The `Service.php` file is responsible for managing various service-related operations in the system. Key functionalities include:

- **Service Management**:
  - Adding, updating, and removing services.
  - Managing service-specific configurations and dependencies.

- **User-Service Interaction**:
  - Handling user interactions with specific services.

- **Data Retrieval**:
  - Fetching service-related data, such as configurations and activity logs.

- **Validation and Security**:
  - Ensuring the correctness and security of service data during interactions.

This file is crucial for maintaining the operability of services and their integration into the larger application.
